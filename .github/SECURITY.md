# Security Policy

Thank you for your interest in the security of the ApexBlock project. We take security very seriously.

## Supported Versions

We are committed to addressing security vulnerabilities in the **latest stable release** of ApexBlock-Privacy-Filter-List. We do not provide security patches for older versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1.  **DO NOT** open a public issue.
2.  **DO NOT** disclose the vulnerability publicly.
3.  Send a detailed report via email to `security@chirag127.com`.
    *   Please include the repository name (`ApexBlock-Privacy-Filter-List`), a description of the vulnerability, affected version(s), and any proof-of-concept or steps to reproduce.
4.  We will acknowledge receipt of your email within 48 hours.
5.  We will work with you to address the vulnerability and will inform you when a fix has been released.

## Security Best Practices

*   **Keep Filter Lists Updated:** Regularly update your filter lists to ensure you are protected against the latest threats and tracking techniques.
*   **Review List Sources:** While ApexBlock curates high-quality lists, always be aware of the origins of your filter lists.
*   **Browser Security:** Ensure your browser is up-to-date and has appropriate security settings enabled.

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We follow a responsible disclosure process. Upon receiving a security report, we will:

*   Confirm the vulnerability and assess its impact.
*   Develop and test a fix.
*   Release the fix in a new version of the filter lists.
*   Publicly disclose the vulnerability (e.g., via release notes) after a fix is available, crediting the reporter if they agree.

We appreciate your efforts in helping to keep ApexBlock secure.
